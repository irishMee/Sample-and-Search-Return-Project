# Sample-and-Search-Return-Project
## Notebook Analysis
1. First, I have uploaded my copy of the notebook in this repository, and all lines of code include comments with explinations.
2. Below are my functions in order to identify obstacles and rocks.
    1. Here is the code for identifying obstacles and a binary image of the rock_img.
        ```python
        #This function will give a binary image for obstacles given an image
        def find_obstacle(img, rgb_thresh=(160, 160, 160)):
            # Create an array of zeros same xy size as img, but single channel
            color_select = np.zeros_like(img[:,:,0])
            # Require that each pixel be below all three threshold values in RGB
            # below_thresh will now contain a boolean array with "True"
            # where threshold was met
            below_thresh = (img[:,:,0] < rgb_thresh[0]) \
                        & (img[:,:,1] < rgb_thresh[1]) \
                        & (img[:,:,2] < rgb_thresh[2])
            # Index the array of zeros with the boolean array and set to 1
            color_select[below_thresh] = 1
            # Return the binary image
            return color_select
        ```    
    2. Here is the code for indentifying rocks and a binary image of the rock_img.
        ```python
        #This function will give the binary immage of rocks given an  image
        def find_rock(img):
    
            # Convert BGR to HSV
            hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

            # define range of yellow color in HSV    
            lower_yellow = np.array([20,100,100])
            upper_yellow = np.array([100,255,190])

            # Threshold the HSV image to get only yellow colors
            mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_yellow, upper_yellow)
    
        return mask
        ```
3. Below is the code written for the process_image() function.
    ```python

    # reading rover position and yaw angle from csv file
    # This function will be used by moviepy to create an output video

        bottom_offset = 6
